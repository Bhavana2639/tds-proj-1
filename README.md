# GitHub Users and Repositories Data from Stockholm

- We collected GitHub data on Stockholm-based users with over 100 followers, using the GitHub API to retrieve user profiles and repository details.
- Analysis showed that Stockholm developers often contribute to repositories with multiple programming languages, highlighting a collaborative, multi-language approach.
- To better engage this community, developers should focus on creating tools that support multilingual project collaboration and open-source development.
